//! The prize money a competition's stages pay: by final position, and per match (#123).
//!
//! A stage played as a league (`[prize_money] stage`: a league, a league phase, a group) points at its competition and
//! at its settings, which hold the amounts in pounds: a list by final position, the first place first, and the amounts
//! per win, draw and loss. A stage that has not started yet (`future_stage`) points at the settings it will be played
//! with, of whichever class; only a league's settings hold these amounts. The game takes them from its database (saves
//! seasons apart hold the same ones) and makes a stage's settings when it sets the stage up. Nothing else the editor
//! reads leads to them, so they are found by their class, in one pass over the game's memory.
//!
//! Settings no stage holds are left over, for instance from setting up a career in the same session, and the editor
//! never changes them. A change is written over the amounts it found and read back, and its undo puts those back the
//! same way. Whether the game pays from these amounts, and whether a change lasts through a save and a reload, is what
//! the probe's `prizes` is there to find out.
