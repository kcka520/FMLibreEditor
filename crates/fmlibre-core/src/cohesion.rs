//! A player's cohesion with his club: the value FM27 Editor (Jackhamerp24's, GPL-3.0) changes as team cohesion, as it
//! saw FMRTE 27 change it.
//!
//! The record a player's `relations` pointer leads to holds, after his list of ties (see `relations.rs`), a second
//! list (see [`CohesionLayout`]): 8-byte entries, each the index of a club or a nation, what it is for, and a value
//! of 1..100. The entry for a club is his cohesion with it. On the macOS Steam save it was 99 for Saka at Arsenal and
//! 2 for Kepa, and 13 to 17 for clubs players had left; the game works a team's cohesion out from it (see the Steam
//! macOS notes). The game gives a player an entry for his club when it signs him; some who had come in by an
//! editor's move had none. FMRTE 27's Improve Team Cohesion, as FM27 Editor observed it, sets the club's entries to
//! 100 and adds none; so does the editor.
